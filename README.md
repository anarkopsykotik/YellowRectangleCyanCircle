# Yellow Rectangle Cyan Circle

A small application that makes one game easier.
The game has two mini-games: 
- in one you need to match fingerprint and it parts
- other is to remember circles positions and put them in right way

In fact this is a small personal project in which I trying to use computer vision to match parts of image and to recognize some shapes. Also I tried some DirectX features: desktop duplication and drawing with direct 2d. 

Here you can see the application in action:
